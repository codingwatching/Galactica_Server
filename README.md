Hello! Welcome on repository of VoxelSrv Server. It's really incomplete for now, but basic things will work. API and structure of this project will change in a future (as for now it's really raw).
I'm open to any PR/suggestions about functionality, API, fixes, etc

## Requirements
- NodeJS 12+
- NPM
- Some free disk space

## Instalation
* Clone/Download this repository
* Rename `default-config.json` to `config.json` and change it to your needs
* Install dependencies (`npm install`) and start it with `npm start`.
* Warning! If you close terminal/console, server will stop. If you want to host it in background, use `screen`, `tmux` or similar software.

## Plugins
For now all plugins are in `plugins` folder. For most stuff you will need probably write your own.

## [Information about API can be found here](https://github.com/Patbox/voxelsrv-server/blob/master/API.md)
